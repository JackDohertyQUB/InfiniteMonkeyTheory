# InfiniteMonkeyTheory
This is a small java project which was inspired by the Infinite Monkey Theorem in which an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite amount of time and typewriters would eventually write out the entire literary collection of William Shakespeare. 

This program in its current version differs from the original theory in version 1 as it only scans for words based on the first letter they type in a given string of 46 characters. This is due to the longest word being 46 characters. In next version I will add the ability to check through whole 46 character string
